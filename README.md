# MRC

Marqeta Hackathon Project

## Requirements

Python version must be `== 3.7`

## Setup

Run `pipenv install` if you are cloning the project for the first time or if any new packages have been added.

## Execution

For development on a unix environment: `pipenv run server`

For development on a windows environment: `pipenv run ws`

- Note, there is no need to run `pipenv shell` before `pipenv run server` as the latter command will execute the script in the venv.
