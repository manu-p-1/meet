# Marqeta Extended Expense Tracker (MEET)

MEET is made for the company willing to forego tradition and move to a tool that lets you have perspective over where your company stands.

Imagine yourself as the manager of your accounting department at Einberg and Ying LLP, your traditional company of today. MEET enables you to keep track of all the expenses in your department, whether they be department wide or down to the minute employee expenditure. With transparency built into MEET as an expectation, losing track of money and having to snoop around to see what went where is a thing of the past.
